# Mindfulness and Meditation for the Uncertain Mind
by Rufo Sanchez

## Synopsis

In recent years, mindfulness and meditation have both become capital-B Buzzwords. It‚Äôs hard to read anything about mental health or ‚Äúwellness‚Äù without a mention, and meditation apps and services are a dime a dozen. Are you curious what they mean?‚Ä¶ but also not really sure if they‚Äôre for you, or worried they‚Äôre for hippies or otherwise, y‚Äôknow, not actually real?

Trust me, I wondered the same thing. In this talk, we‚Äôll go over what mindfulness and meditation can be: effective tools to help observe the emotional reactions and thought patterns that rule our day - and our interactions with other humans - without us even realizing it. We‚Äôll cover the basics in an objective, non-judgmental way, you‚Äôll finally figure out what mindfulness and meditation are, and you‚Äôll come away with resources to start becoming more mindful in your own life.

## Resources

The list here is by absolutely no means exhaustive, but links to resources I‚Äôve either found helpful or heave heard are great for others. If you have others you think would be good, please feel free to [drop me a line](mailto:me@ru.fo) or open a PR üôÇ

## A few books
[10% Happier, by Dan Harris](https://smile.amazon.com/10-Happier-Reduced-Self-Help-Actually/dp/B00I8NLVFY/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2EMQUDVYTZ6RA&keywords=10%25+happier+-+dan+harris&qid=1556811913&s=gateway&sprefix=10%25+happi%2Caps%2C1073&sr=8-1) - a little more about how Dan came to meditate, a little less how-to

[Real Happiness, by Sharon Salzberg](https://smile.amazon.com/Real-Happiness-Meditation-28-Day-Program/dp/0761159258/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1556812023&sr=8-2) - written by an incredibly experienced teacher

All of the above books have great references too. I‚Äôd also look through Sharon Salzburg‚Äôs other books, and Joseph Goldstein is another well-regarded author whose talks I enjoyed.

## Apps
While you don‚Äôt need an app, and the commercialization of something that is at its most basic is free and very easy gives me pause, they can be a great way to get started and get exposed to a variety of different meditation types. The two I‚Äôve used are  [Headspace](https://www.headspace.com) and [10% Happier](https://www.tenpercent.com). Headspace has a great introduction to meditation, and most of their content is read by cofounder Andy Puddicombe, so it‚Äôs fairly consistent. 10% Happier on the other hand takes the approach of collecting meditations from a wide variety of teachers, often collected into courses that have brief interviews or talks between the teacher and Dan talking about something mindful.

Both of the above apps are subscription-based, so it‚Äôs worth trying them out and seeing what you prefer. If you want something free, [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com) is a choice I‚Äôve used in the past just for a meditation timer but also has many free guided meditations. Other apps I haven‚Äôt tried: [Calm](https://www.calm.com), [Oak](https://www.oakmeditation.com).

I really enjoy the writings of David Cain at [Raptitude](https://www.raptitude.com), discussing the effects of mindfulness on your day to day life. Some example posts:
